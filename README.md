# Gaussian Practice

This GitHub repository is provided as a source of sample Gaussian input files for individuals learning how to use the program. Subdirectories are provided for different types of calculations. Within each subdirectory, documentation giving an overview of the topic, example jobs, and a list of general resources are provided.

This repository is not meant to replace other excellent resources. Rather, it is meant to suppliment and add to those other resources.
